{% if stage == "list-events" %}
Here are our events:
{% for event in events %}
 - {{ event.name }}
{% endfor %}
Which one do you want to delete (type the name)
{% elif stage == "confirm" %}
Are you sure you want to delete {{event.name}}? I can't take responsibility for
the consequences! (Yes/No)
{% elif stage == "done" %}
All done!
{% elif stage == "missing" %}
I couldn't find that task, did you type that correctly?
{% elif stage == "cancel" %}
Changed your mind? All good!
{% endif %}
